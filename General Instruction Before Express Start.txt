The general rule of Node is that if you plan to use an npm module with require(), then you need to install it locally (i.e., in node_modules). Thus, for a new project, create a folder and a package.json file:

mkdir express-hello-world
cd express-hello-world
npm init -y
Then, you can install express as a dependency locally:

npm install express
Or with an exact version:

npm install express@4.13.3
Installing Scaffolding

There's another module called Express Generator which is a scaffolding. Developers use the generator to jump start their Express development because the generator will create files and folders for different template engines and CSS libraries

Install Express.js command-line generator:

npm install -g express-generator
Using the Generator

Now we can use the CLI to spawn new Express.js apps.

express todo-list-app
cd todo-list-app
npm install
npm start
The Express.js Generator Command-Line Interface offers support for CSS libraries and template engines. For example, to create an app with Stylus support, type the following:

express -c styl express-styl
Then, as the instructions in the terminal tells us (Figure 2-5), type:

cd express-styl && npm install
DEBUG=my-application ./bin/www
Open the browser of your choice at http://localhost:3000 to view the result.
